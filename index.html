        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a fourth year computer science student born and raised in Toronto, Canada, studying at the Lassonde School of Engineering - York University. I have major interests in software and technology, and am currently seeking job opportunities for the coming 2023 summer and/or fall terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          With 1 year of professional work eperience and mutliple years of academic studies, I have gained extensive knowledge of computer sciecne and software development. I take pride in applying the valuable skills I learned along the way to solving real world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of the software world I have a passion for the great outdoors, health and fitness, and tasting interesting yet uncommon foods. I spend my personal time indulging in these interests along with a few other hobbies such as working on personal software development projects.
